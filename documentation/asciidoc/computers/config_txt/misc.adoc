== Miscellaneous Options

=== `avoid_warnings`

The xref:configuration.adoc#firmware-warning-icons[warning symbols] can be disabled using this option, although this is not advised.

`avoid_warnings=1` disables the warning overlays.
`avoid_warnings=2` disables the warning overlays, but additionally allows turbo mode even when low-voltage is present.

=== `logging_level`

Sets the VideoCore logging level. The value is a VideoCore-specific bitmask.

=== `max_usb_current`

WARNING: This command is now deprecated and has no effect.

Originally certain models of Raspberry Pi limited the USB ports to a maximum of 600mA. Setting `max_usb_current=1` changed this default to 1200mA. However, all firmware now has this flag set by default, so it is no longer necessary to use this option.
