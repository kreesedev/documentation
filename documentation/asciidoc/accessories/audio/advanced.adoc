=== GPIO usage 

Raspberry Pi audio boards take advantage of a number of pins on the GPIO header in
order to operate successfully. Some of these pins are solely for the use of the board, and
some can be shared with other peripherals, sensors, etc.

The following Raspberry Pi GPIO pins will be used by the audio boards:

* All power pins
* All ground pins
* GPIO 2/3 (I2C)
* GPIO 18/19/20/21 (I2S)

If appropriate then the following are also used:

* GPIO 22 (DigiAMP+ mute/unmute support)
* GPIO 23/24 for rotary encoder (physical volume control) or status LED (Codec Zero)
* GPIO 25 for the IR Sensor
* GPIO 27 for the rotary encoder push switch/Codec Zero switch

=== DAC PRO, DAC{plus}, DigiAMP{plus}, Codec Zero

The DAC PRO, DAC{plus} and DigiAMP{plus} re-expose the Raspberry Pi signals, allowing additional sensors and peripherals
to be added easily. Please note that some signals are for exclusive use (I2S and EEPROM) by some
of our boards; others such as I2C can be shared across multiple boards.
