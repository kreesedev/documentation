=== Saving AlsaMixer settings

To store the AlsaMixer settings, add the following at the command line:

----
$ sudo alsactl store
----

You can save the current state to a file, then reload that state at startup.

To save:

----
$ sudo alsactl store -f /home/pi/usecase.state
----

To restore a saved file:

----
$ sudo alsactl restore -f /home/pi/usecase.state
----

=== Using external USB devices

If you want to enable 1.2 amp USB support (to allow USB hard disks to power up when
accessory boards are in use), you may also want to add the following line to your `/boot/config.txt`
file:

----
max_usb_current=1
----


=== MPD-based audio with volume control

To allow Music Player Daemon (MPD)-based audio software to control the audio boardâ€™s built in volume, the file
`/etc/mpd.conf` may need to be changed to support the correct AlsaMixer name.

This can be achieved by ensuring the 'Audio output' section of `/etc/mpd.conf` has the 'mixer_control'
line. Below is an example for the Texas Instruments-based boards (DAC
PRO/DAC{plus}/DigiAMP{plus}):

----
audio_output {
    type "alsa"
    name "ALSA Device"
    mixer_control "Digital"
}
----

=== Hardware information

* PCB screws are all M2.5.
* PCB standoffs (for case) are 5mm male/female.
* PCB standoffs (for Raspberry Pi to audio boards) are 9mm female/female.
* PCB standoffs (for XLR to DAC PRO) are 8mm female/male.
* PCB standoffs (for the official Raspberry Pi 7-inch display) are 5mm male/female.
* The rotary encoders we have used and tested are the Alpha three-pin rotary encoder
RE160F-40E3-20A-24P, the ALPS EC12E2430804 (RS: 729-5848), and the Bourns ECW0JB24-AC0006L (RS: 263-2839).
* The barrel connector used for powering the DigiAMP{plus} is 2.5mmID, 5.5mmOD, 11mm.
* The DigiAMP{plus} is designed to operate with a 12V to 24V, 3A supply such as the XPPower
VEC65US19 or similar.
* The DigiAMP{plus} uses CamdenBoss two-part connectors. Those fitted to the PCB are 
CTBP9350/2AO.
* The speaker terminal used on the Codec Zero will accept wires of between 14~26 AWG
(wire of max 1.6mm in diameter).
